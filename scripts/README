HOW TO RUN EXPERIMENTS ON A CLUSTER

Follow the following steps to setup a new cluster for gstore.
 - Followed the comment in lib/config.py to setup ssh forwarding.
 - Make sure you have password-less sudo on each client and server.
 - Make sure the host names are known by ssh (which should ok now since you
   have already sshed into each client and server to setup password-less sudo).
 - Add your own cluster definition (say 'harvard') into exp/config.py
 - Add machine initializaion function into your controlling machine's
   lib/data/gstore_commands.sh, say 'reinstall_gstore_harvard'.
 - Install gstore on both servers and clients with:
    $./exp/run_cluster.py --cluster=harvard \
      --clientConfig=reinstall_gstore_harvard \
      --serverConfig=reinstall_gstore_harvard
    
To run all workloads of an experiment (say on pdos), use:
 $./lib/run_cluster.py --cluster=pdos -e twitter
    
To run specific workloads of an experiments, use '-l':
 $./lib/run_cluster.py --cluster=pdos -e twitter -l auto_w50_r1000
